We first classify the various backgrounds and then describe them in more detail one at a time.
We note that two important backgrounds for the charged-pion polarizability experiment do not contribute in this experiment:
First, coherent $\rho^0$ photo-production is absent in this
experiment because the $\rho^0$ decay into the $\pi^0\pi^0$ channel is prohibited by I-spin conservation.  Second, $\mu^+\mu^-$ production is also not a factor for the neutral pion case.
We have the following categories of backgrounds:
\begin{itemize}
\item Coherent production: In this case, the target remains intact. Generically, one may classify the two-pion production
according to the sketches in Fig.\,\ref{fig:Diagram}. The left-hand diagram represents the exchange of a virtual photon with the nucleus, i.e. the Primakoff
mechanism. This mechanism is very long range, approximately 100 fm, and is affected minimally by the effects of shadowing or absorption.  This is the signal for the
experiment and our goal is to determine its cross section.
The right-hand diagram represents the exchange of a strongly interacting particle (or trajectory) and effectively results in the production of pions at the
surface of the nucleus. We note that for the neutral pion production, pion exchange is not allowed due to charge conjugation conservation, while 
for the charged pion case, single pion exchange is related to the axial anomaly ($\gamma \pi^0 \rightarrow \pi^+ \pi^-$).  When the interaction leaves the
nuclear target intact, the reaction is referred to as ``nuclear coherent'' and this is our most serious background. 
\item Incoherent production:  When the interaction produces two pions in the quasi-elastic scattering off a single
nucleon, the scattered target usually fragments into particles that range out in the target and are unobservable experimentally. This reaction occurs at larger $-t$ and is generally
kinematically distinct from the signal. The $\pi^0\pi^0$ momentum relative to the photon polarization plane does differentiate between the Primakoff and incoherent production.
\item Any reaction that may be confused with the signal within the experimental resolution or limited acceptance:
 An example of this type of reaction is Primakoff production of $\eta$ mesons, where the $\eta\rightarrow \pi^0 \pi^0 \pi^0$  is
mis-reconstructed as a two-pion final state. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Coherent backgrounds}
   
 The largest coherent background is  
from the $f_0(500)(J^{PC}=0^{++})$, also called the $\sigma$ meson, and the $f_0(980)$ photo-production.  The width of the
$f_0(980)$ is fairly narrow and does not contribute directly to the strength near threshold.
The $f_0(500)$width is much
broader, from 400 to 700 MeV, with significant overlap in the
invariant mass region of interest.  Since the $f_0(500)$ is a scalar
particle with the same spin-parity as the $\gamma \gamma \rightarrow
\pi^0\pi^0$ final state near threshold, the azimuthal distribution of
the $\pi^0$ momentum or the $\pi^0\pi^0$ c.m. momentum relative to the
photon polarization plane does not differentiate between coherent
$f_0(500)$ production and the Primakoff reaction.  
This is similar to the Primex-$\pi^0$ experiment, where the dominant background was
nuclear coherent $\pi^0$ photo-production.  The approach used in the
Primex analysis was to measure the $\pi^0$ angular distribution,
effectively the $t$-distribution, then use theoretical calculations of
the angular distributions to separate out contributions from Primakoff
and nuclear coherent. The analysis of the $\pi^0\pi^0$ (NPP) reaction
will approximately parallel what was done for the Primex-$\pi^0$
analysis.  

We parameterize the $\sigma$ meson as detailed in Appendix\,\ref{sec:NCsigma} and assume that the production amplitude can be factorized as
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathcal{A} & = & \mathcal{A}_t(t) \, \mathcal{A}_W(m_{\pi\pi}) \, \mathcal{A}_\tau(\Phi, \phi, \theta),
\end{eqnarray}
where the last factor represents the angular distribution that results in a 
dependence on the di-pion azimuthal angle, $\phi_{\pi\pi}$, of the form $\mathcal{A}_\tau \propto (1 + \mathcal{P} \cos{2\phi_{\pi\pi}}$). 
The mass dependence is given by the S-wave phase shifts that dominate the mass region below 0.8 GeV. We use the approximate description given in 
Appendix\,\ref{sec:ParmSwave}.\footnote{More detailed studies may require including contributions from the D-wave and S-wave, I=2, amplitudes.}

\end{center}
\end{figure}

We assume the $-t$ dependence of the $\sigma$ has a similar form as for single $\pi^0$ production, namely $\mathcal{A}_t(t) \propto \sin{\theta_{\pi\pi}} \times F_{st}(t)$.  The $\sin{\theta_{\pi\pi}}$ 
comes from the spin-flip required at forward angles to produce a $0^+$ system from a spin-zero target. The factor $F_{st}(t)$ is the strong form factor for the target, which is approximated to
match calculations for the single $\pi^0$ production (Fig.\,6 from Ref.\cite{Gevorkyan:2009ge}). Our Gaussian approximation to the form factor is shown in Fig.\,\ref{fig:strongFF} along side the calculation for single 
$\pi^0$ production. Efforts are underway to calculate the strong form factor for this reaction.\footnote{S. Gevorkyan, private communication.}.
The Primex data showed that the nuclear coherent process is highly
suppressed for heavy nuclei, as shown in Fig.\ref{fig:leaddndt}.  The reason for the suppression is
$\pi^0$ absorption in the nuclear interior, making the coherent
production primarily a surface effect, i.e. proportional to $A$ and
not $A^2$.  For NPP it is expected that suppression of the nuclear  
coherent will be approximately twice stronger than that seen in Primex because two pions
are produced in NPP as compared to a single $\pi^0$ in Primex.

\subsection{Fits to the scattering angle}
The Primakoff reaction is peaked at very small scattering angle $\theta_{\pi\pi} \sim m_{\pi\pi}^2 / 2E_\gamma^2 \sim 0.1-0.2^\circ$ for masses between 0.35 and 0.5 GeV, as shown in 
Fig.\,\ref{fig:fit_Primakoff_sigma}a.  Nevertheless it is still an
order-of-magnitude larger than the scattering angle for single $\pi^0$ production. The angular distribution for the nuclear coherent process on lead is shown in Fig.\,\ref{fig:fit_Primakoff_sigma}b, which 
peaks at an angle of about $\theta_{\pi\pi} \sim 0.7^\circ$. The coherent sum of both processes, e.g. Fig.\,\ref{fig:fit_Primakoff_sigma}c and d, is a distribution that is considerably wider than the 
Primakoff distribution alone, but a fit is required to determine the Primakoff signal. The amplitude of the NC component in Fig.\,\ref{fig:fit_Primakoff_sigma}d was generated with an amplitude that
is twice that in Fig.\,\ref{fig:fit_Primakoff_sigma}c.  In order to extract the Primakoff component, we proceed as follows: We first parameterize the shapes of the Primakoff and
NC components separately, as shown with the curves in Fig.\,\ref{fig:fit_Primakoff_sigma}a and b and the parameters for those shapes are fixed. Two distributions generated using both the Primakoff and
NC amplitudes are shown in the bottom plots of Fig.\,\ref{fig:fit_Primakoff_sigma}c and d and then fit to the sum of the two distributions plus an interference term. We let the normalization of each
component vary as well as the size of the interference term. The resulting fitted parameters are shown on the figures. From this exercise we conclude that the determination of 2000 signal Primakoff 
events can be determined with a statistical uncertainty of about 5\%. 
   
\subsection{Incoherent backgrounds}
The inelastic and incoherent reactions that might contribute to the data include
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
    \item nuclear coherent production of $\eta$ followed by $\eta\rightarrow \pi^0\pi^0\pi^0 \rightarrow \gamma\gamma\gamma\gamma(\gamma\gamma)$, where two of the six decay photons go unobserved
    \item $\gamma N \rightarrow N \pi^0\pi^0$
\end{enumerate}
The first reaction is an inelastic, coherent process, and as such
could produce a significant rate for a heavy nuclear target. Rejecting 
events that do not satisfy our elastic selection and the constraint that the four photons must reconstruct to two $\pi^0$'s mass should eliminate most of these events. 
Additional gammas in the final state can also be used to suppress this
background.  
The second reaction is an incoherent process, and is
small relative to coherent processes.  The Primex analysis showed that
incoherent reactions generally peak at angles larger than about 1$^\circ$ and had a small effect on the extraction of the
Primakoff $\pi^0$ cross sections. Likewise, we expect that incoherent processes to be a small issue for this experiment. The $\pi^0\pi^0$ momentum relative to the photon polarization plane does differentiate between Primakoff and incoherent production.
