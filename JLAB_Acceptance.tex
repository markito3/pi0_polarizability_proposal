\subsection{Expected signal}
In order to estimate rates, resolution and acceptance due to the
Primakoff reaction on lead, $\gamma ^{208}\rm{Pb}\rightarrow \pi^0
\pi^0\, \rm{Pb}$, we take the reaction process to be the same as for
charged pion production and given in Eq. 8 of the Proposal for the
Charged Pion Polarizability experiment \cite{CPPexp}, which is
reproduced here for convenience:
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{d^2\sigma}{d\Omega_{\pi\pi}dW_{\pi\pi}} = \frac{2\alpha Z^2}{\pi^2} \frac{E^4_\gamma \beta^2}{W_{\pi\pi}} \frac{\sin^2\theta_{\pi\pi}}{Q^4} |F(Q^2)|^2 \sigma(\gamma\gamma\rightarrow\pi^0\pi^0) (1+P_\gamma \cos{2\phi_{\pi\pi}}).   \label{eq:PrimakoffSignal}
\end{eqnarray}
The $\gamma\gamma$ cross section for charged pions has been
substituted with the cross section for neutral pions, namely
$\sigma(\gamma\gamma\rightarrow\pi^0\pi^0)$. In this expression,
$\Omega_{\pi\pi}$ is the solid angle in the laboratory frame for the
emission of the $\pi\pi$ system, $W_{\pi\pi}$ is the $\pi\pi$
invariant mass, Z is the atomic number of the target, $\beta$ is the
velocity of the $\pi\pi$ system, $E_\gamma$ is the energy of the
incident photon, $F(Q^2)$ is the electromagnetic form factor for the
target with final-state-interactions (FSI) corrections applied,
$\theta_{\pi\pi}$ is the lab angle for the $\pi\pi$ system,
$\phi_{\pi\pi}$ is the azimuthal angle of the $\pi\pi$ system relative
to the incident photon polarization, and $P_\gamma$ is the incident
photon polarization.\footnote{The expression for the cross section in
  terms of invariant quantities can be found in
  Ref.\,\cite{hdnote3186}.}

\end{figure}

The cross section for $\sigma(\gamma\gamma\rightarrow\pi^0\pi^0)$ has
been measured by the Crystal Ball Collaboration
\cite{Marsiske:1990hx}, albeit with limited statistical precision. We
have parameterized the cross section for $W_{\pi\pi}<0.8$ GeV, which
is of specific interest to this program as shown in
Fig.\ref{fig:sigma_2pi0_figs_1}. Using this parameterization and
Eq.\ref{eq:PrimakoffSignal}, we can calculate the photoproduction
cross section on lead, which is shown in
Fig.\ref{fig:sigma_2pi0_figs_2}.

\caption{Primakoff cross section for $\gamma Pb \rightarrow Pb\, \pi^0 \pi^0$ using the parameterization of  $\sigma(\gamma\gamma\rightarrow \pi^0\pi^0)$ in the previous figure. The integrated cross section is 0.35\,$\mu$b/nucleus.
\label{fig:sigma_2pi0_figs_2}}
\end{figure}
The integrated cross section is 0.35\,$\mu$b/nucleus. For reference,
we note that the cross section for charged pions $(\pi^+\pi^-$)
production is 10.9\,$\mu$b, a factor of 30 larger.

The number of neutral-pion-Primakoff-signal events produced during 20
PAC days is shown in Fig.\ref{fig:sigma_2pi0_figs_3}. The impacts of
detector trigger, acceptance and resolution are discussed in the next
section.

For this calculation, it is assumed the detector has perfect resolution and has a linearly increasing efficiency from zero at threshold up to 0.6 at 0.34 GeV (see top right of Fig.\,\ref{fig:twopi_primakoff_DSelect_p1_W_100000_sum} ).

\subsection{Detector resolution}
\label{sec:acceptance}
The response of the GlueX detector to neutral pion Primakoff events
was simulated using the standard GlueX generation and reconstruction
tools, but with the specific geometry for the CPP experiment. The
schematic of the detector configuration is shown in
Fig.\,\ref{fig:GlueX_cpp}. The primary differences between the
standard GlueX geometry and CPP are summarized in
Table\,\ref{tab:ccp_config}. For this experiment, the main differences
include a) coherent peak position at 5.5-6 GeV and re-positioning of
the microscope to cover the coherent peak, b) solid $^{208}$Pb at
z=1cm, and c) Start counter removed. For the CPP experiment, the
addition of muon identification chambers behind the FCAL is
critical. However, for neutral pions this addition plays no role
because the photons are detected in the FCAL. The GEANT3 simulation,
which is used for these studies, includes most changes except for the
addition of the muon chambers, which are not needed. In addition, the
microscope geometry has not been modified and we use the tagger
hodoscope for that region in the simulation. The slightly reduced
energy of the hodoscope relative to the microscope has little impact
and the gaps between counters is ignored by simulating the tagged
flux.

\end{figure}

The Primakoff signal was generated according to the cross section
described in the previous chapter, using a modified version of the
\emph{gen\_2pi\_primakoff} event generator to generate $\pi^0$'s
instead of charged pions. By default, the production amplitudes are
symmetrized between the two identical $\pi^0$'s by AmpTools. One
hundred thousand events were generated with $M_{\pi\pi}<$0.5 GeV and
with no background, fed to GEANT3 to track particles, and subsequently
processed using \emph{mcsmear} to simulate the detector response. The
simulated events were then analyzed using the GlueX event filter to
analyze the reaction $\gamma Pb \rightarrow \pi^0 \pi^0$ with a
missing Pb nucleus and constraining the detected photon pairs to the
$\pi^0$ mass.  The output of the reconstruction, both kinematically
fit and ``measured" quantities, were available for inspection.

In the following we show various reconstructed quantities as well as
estimated resolutions. The distribution of generated photon energy and
the unconstrained reconstructed momenta of the two pions are shown in
Fig.\,\ref{fig:EgP1P2_signal_DSelector}.
\begin{figure}[tph]

\includegraphics[width=6in]{figures/EgP1P2_signal_DSelector.pdf}
\caption{Left: Generated photon energies. Center: Reconstructed momentum distribution of one $\pi^0$. Right: Reconstructed momentum distribution of the second $\pi^0$.
\label{fig:EgP1P2_signal_DSelector}}
\end{figure}
The missing mass, 2$\pi$ mass and $-t$ distributions are shown in Fig.\,\ref{fig:MMMpipit_signal_DSelector}.
\begin{figure}[tph]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=6in]{figures/MMMpipit_signal_DSelector.pdf}
\caption{Left: Missing mass distribution minus the mass of the recoil nucleus. Center: Kinematically fit $2\pi$ mass distribution. Right: Kinematically fit -t distribution.
\label{fig:MMMpipit_signal_DSelector}}
\end{figure}
The reconstructed momentum relative to its generated value is shown in
Fig.\ref{fig:DeltapDeltaPhi_signal_DSelector}. The central peak of the
kinematicall fit momentum is about 2\%, similar to that for charged
pions. However, there are long uniform tails that will effect the
final reconstruction. The resolution of the azimuthal angle,
$\phi_{\pi\pi}$, between the production and the photon polarization
planes is quite poor owing to the fact that the pion pairs are
produced at very shallow angles. Nevertheless it is sufficient to
measure the asymmetry due to the photon beam polarization.

\end{figure}
The resolution of the 2$\pi$ invariant mass is shown in Fig.\,\ref{fig:Resolution_Mpipittag_signal_DSelector}, along with the resolution of Mandelstam $-t$, and the reconstructed time resolution. The mass resolution is about 8\,MeV.

%Right: Timing resolution relative to the accelerator RF signal is about 0.35 ns.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Trigger and acceptance}
The Primakoff reaction will transfer all the energy of the beam into
four photons, which are going forward. All this energy will be
deposited in the FCAL, except for leakage down the beampipe. We expect
a simple trigger with an energy threshold in the FCAL should have very
high efficiency for any events that can be reconstructed.

The acceptance of the signal events can be determined by comparing the
kinematically fit to the generated distributions. The generated and
kinematically fit 2$\pi$ mass, $\phi_{\pi\pi}$ and $-t$ distributions
are shown in
Fig.\,\ref{fig:twopi_primakoff_DSelect_p1_W_100000_sum}. The
reconstruction was described in the previous section.
\begin{figure}[tph]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=6in]{figures/twopi_primakoff_DSelect_p1_W_100000_sum.pdf}
\caption{Top left: Generated and kinematically fit 2$\pi$ mass distribution. Top right: Acceptance as a function of 2$\pi$ mass. Events above $M_{\pi\pi}>$0.5 GeV were eliminated from the analysis. The acceptance is about 60\%. Bottom left: Generated and kinematically fit azimuthal angle $\phi_{\pi\pi}$. Bottom right: Generated and kinematically fit $-t$ distribution. There is significant slewing of the measured distribution to large $-t$.}
\label{fig:twopi_primakoff_DSelect_p1_W_100000_sum}
\end{figure}
The acceptance is quite high at about 60\%. However, there is also
significant slewing due to resolution in most variables of
interest. The main effect of resolution in the 2$\pi$ mass happens at
threshold and the distortions above that are not very great. The
relatively poor resolution in $\phi_{\pi\pi}$ results in dilution of
the measured azimuthal dependence, which will need to be adjusted
based on simulation. Finally the $-t$ resolution softens the measured
t-slope due to the smearing of high rate regions down to low rate
regions.
