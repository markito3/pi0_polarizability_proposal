\section{Errors and Sensitivity}
We summarize the anticipated errors in the determination of the $\pi^0$ polarizability. We assume 
20 days of running on a 5\% radiation length $^{208}$Pb target, 10$^7$ photons/s, and nominal acceptance for $\pi^0 \pi^0$.
Table \ref{errors} summarizes the estimated statistical and systematic errors. In the following we describe each of
these contributions in detail:

\begin{enumerate}

\item
Primakoff signal extraction from the angular distribution (Fig.\,\ref{fig:fit_Primakoff_sigma}), which also contains nuclear coherent contributions to the cross section. This uncertainty
is approximately 5\%.

\item
Flux normalization. We have several methods for determining the flux (Section\,\ref{sec:flux}). The Primex-D experiment expects an uncertainty of 1.5\% and we use that as our estimate here.

\item
Subtraction of backgrounds other than nuclear coherent. These backgrounds are not expected to be significant ($< 1\%$) and studies are on-going. 

\item
Detector acceptance and efficiency. We can measure the detector acceptance times efficiency for the process $\gamma Pb \rightarrow \pi^0 Pb$ with an accuracy of 3.5\% (Section\,\ref{sec:pi0norm}), which
should allow us to reduce the systematic uncertainty in the acceptance calculation for the process of interest to this level.

\item
Total systematic error (items 2-4): combining the systematic errors in quadrature gives 3.9\%.

\item 
Error on cross section (quadrature sum of statistical and systematic uncertainties): 6.3\%.

\item
The current estimate by Dai and Pennington (Table II in Ref.\,\cite{Dai:2016ytz}) indicates
that a 13\% determination of
$\sigma(\gamma\gamma\rightarrow\pi^0\pi^0)$ will determine the
combination $\alpha_{\pi^0}-\beta_{\pi^0}$ to a precision of 100\%, i.e., $\Delta(\alpha_{\pi^0}-\beta_{\pi^0}) \sim 7.7\Delta(\sigma$) .
From here we estimate that our uncertainty on $\Delta(\alpha_{\pi^0}-\beta_{\pi^0}) \sim$ 49\%. We note that the basis for extracting the polarizabilities may be improved
in the near future and theoretical effort is being directed specifically toward this goal.

\section{Summary and beam request}
We have investigated the possibility of determining the neutral pion
polarizabilities $\alpha_{\pi^0}-\beta_{\pi^0}$, a quantity for which there are no existing measurements.
Our proposal is to extract the polarizability from a 
measurement of the cross section of the Primakoff reaction $\gamma
\rm{Pb}\rightarrow \pi^0 \pi^0 \rm{Pb}$. We propose to make this
measurement using data taken simultaneously with the CPP\cite{CPPexp}
experiment in Hall D. Table \ref{request} summarizes the approved beam request for the CPP experiment.
The existing GlueX detector has sufficient
resolution and high acceptance for this process. We expect to collect approximately 2500 signal events during the
approved 20 PAC days. The anticipated statistical uncertainties on
the signal represent a significant improvement over existing data as shown in Fig.\,\ref{fig:sigma_2pi0_figs_4}.
Using the estimate by Dai and Pennington \cite{Dai:2016ytz} we expect to be able to make the first extraction of the 
$\alpha_{\pi^0}-\beta_{\pi^0}$ polarizability with an uncertainty of 49\%.
